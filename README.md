# multi_agent_bfs.py
A lightweight concept demo showing how role-based AI agents can collaborate to solve tasks. The system uses breadth-first search (BFS) to illustrate how agents could scale, and supports adaptive spawning of new specialized agents when gaps are detected.


Multi-Agent BFS Pipeline (Conceptual Prototype)

Note: This project is a conceptual prototype intended for demonstration and learning purposes. It is not production-ready.

Overview

The Multi-Agent BFS Pipeline is a lightweight framework that simulates collaboration between role-based agents (e.g., planner, architect, implementer, tester). Each agent is powered by a causal language model (default: GPT-2) and produces concise, role-specific outputs. The system also includes a breadth-first search (BFS) expansion preview to illustrate how roles could scale across multiple levels.

This project is designed to showcase the concept of multi-agent reasoning pipelines in a transparent and modular way.

Key Features

Role-driven reasoning: Decomposes tasks into specialized roles (planner, architect, implementer, tester, plus optional extras).

Concise outputs: Each agent produces short, controlled responses (single sentences or bullets).

BFS role expansion: Prints how agent roles would expand level-by-level, serving as a conceptual scaling sketch.

Model flexibility: Defaults to gpt2 for speed, but supports any Hugging Face causal LM.

Minimal agent memory: Agents maintain a lightweight rolling memory of recent lines for context continuity.

Adaptive Spawning (Dynamic Agents)

Idea: Start with a core team, evaluate their outputs each round, and spawn specialized agents on demand when quality is low or skills are missing.

When to spawn (examples):

Low evaluator score (e.g., < 7/10).

Critic flags gaps (e.g., missing data/APIs, unclear UX, deployment concerns).

Backlog/uncertainty grows (e.g., many TODOs or "unknown/blocked").

How it works here:

A simple spawn policy maps detected gaps â†’ suggested roles (e.g., api_integrator, ux_writer, data_cleaner, researcher).

Caps via --max-agents and --max-rounds avoid combinatorial explosion.

Still concept-level; swap in a small instruction-tuned model for better adherence.
